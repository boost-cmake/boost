# This lists all the toolsets we will test with the Boost CI
# scripts. Predef needs to check all of them as its job is to
# distiguish between all of them. For other libraries you would
# want to limit the list to the toolsets that are important
# for that.
#
# This also includes setting up how to create the cache. We
# opt for slightly better compression and solid archives.
# As we have a lot of files in the boost tree which is what
# we are putting in the cache.
